# README

The purpose of this project is to build a tool that allows for a calendar view of the months ahead and informs the administrator of a nursing facility when beds will become available. Additionally the app should provide a day-by-day census for the facility as well as a breakdown in pay-types from Medicare, Medi-Cal and private pay.

## Version 1
- A simple calendar view with room list and current patients.
- A weekly synopsis of the % rooms utilized.
- A notification system to allow the admin to know when rooms will become available and how many of those rooms must be Medicare.
- Weekly email informing the admin of the upcoming discharges.
